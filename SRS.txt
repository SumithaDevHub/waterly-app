- **FR-3.6**: System shall award "Getting Started" achievement after logging 5L total
- **FR-3.7**: System shall award "Well Hydrated" achievement after logging 50L total
- **FR-3.8**: System shall award "Waterfall" achievement after logging 1L in single session
- **FR-3.9**: Achievements shall only be awarded once and persist permanently
- **FR-3.10**: System shall display locked achievements with lock icon and unlock requirements


#### 2.4 Statistics Dashboard
